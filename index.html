<p style="color:grey" class="serif">A new federal law called SESTA (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) has endangered sex workers and resulted in their erasure from online platforms that once provided work, community and safety.</p>

<p style="color:grey" class="serif">Organized in collaboration with Melissa Gira Grant and Danielle Blunt and Eyebeam, <strong>Hacking//Hustling: A Platform for Sex Workers in a Post-SESTA World</strong> is a two-day program of conversations and tactical skill sharing led by sex workers to generate knowledge that has been erased in the wake of SESTA.</p>

<p style="color:grey" class="serif"><strong>Hacking//Hustling</strong> is a space for digital rights advocates, journalists, and allied communities to come learn from sex workers and better understand the developing effects of SESTA on internet freedom for all. We believe that sex workers are the experts on their own experience and that an internet that is safe for sex workers is an internet that is safe for almost everyone.</p>
